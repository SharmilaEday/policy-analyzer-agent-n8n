Policy Analyzer Agent — n8n Workflow

> An agentic n8n workflow that fetches real-time policy data, runs AI-powered sentiment analysis and summarization via Gemini, and delivers structured results to Google Sheets and email — automatically.

---

## Overview

This workflow is a fully automated **policy intelligence agent** built in n8n. It monitors and analyzes policies (regulatory, corporate, government, etc.) in real time, uses **Google Gemini** to generate sentiment scores and plain-language summaries, and pushes the output to a **Google Sheets dashboard** while simultaneously sending a **formatted email report** to relevant stakeholders.

No manual reading. No copy-pasting. Just actionable policy insights on autopilot.

| 3. **Gemini AI Analysis** | Sends policy text to Gemini for sentiment analysis + summarization |
| 4. **Structured Output** | Parses AI response into clean, structured fields |
